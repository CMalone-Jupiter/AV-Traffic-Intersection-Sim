# Summary
The following files are used to simulate AV decision algorithms at intersections with staggered stop lines. The simulator uses the Australian driving convention - i.e. cars are driving on the left-hand side of the road.

# Controls
Arrow keys change the direction the AV is trying to drive/navigate the intersection (i.e. straight through, left turn or right turn).  
'Space' triggers the AV to try to navigate the intersection.  
'B' toggles a blocker vehicle, which is parked ahead of the AV at the staggered stopline.  
'R' resets the simulator.  

# Layout
This simulator uses the following layout:
